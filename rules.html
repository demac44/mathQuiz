        <p>Question is randomly generated and they get harder as you reach safe points. If your answer is incorrect,you
            fall to the last safe point. Safe points are 1000,32000 and 1000000. You can quit game at any time
            and take whatever you earned. You have two jokers: 50-50 and Audience. 50-50 removes two wrong answers,so
            you are left with one wrong and the correct answer. Joker Audience gives you percentage of which answer
            is most possibly correct but also audience can be wrong sometimes. All answers are integers. If the question
            is division you have to round the result to smaller integer to get the correct answer.<br>Good luck!</p>
